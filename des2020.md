# **Design Homework**

**Please complete Task 1 and Task 2. Task 3 is a bonus**

## Task 1

This is an explorative task to see what you come up with.

Users of the [Stears Business website](https://www.stearsng.com) would like to find articles they are interested in quickly. Currently they have to scroll and search through the different pages (business, governance, etc) to find an article they are looking for.

1. Propose a solution to this problem
2. Create detailed designs showing how a user will use your solution

Save your design in .png / .jpg / .pdf format along with its original form

## Task 2

This is a task that represents the kind of work you will do whilst working with us

We need to update the [Election Data Centre](http://nigeriaelections.stearsng.com) site, using a custom built control panel. We need to add a tab, and data for the 2011 elections.

**Design a page on the control panel that does the following**:

- Displays all current 'years' as a table with columns - 'year', 'states', 'LGAs', 'races', 'date added'
- Displays each row as a single year with minimal information according to the columns
- Displays a call to action on each row, allowing the user 'edit' the year
- Allows the user to 'add', 'edit' or 'delete' a 'year' or 'see more'

The 'year' and 'date added' are text.
The 'states', 'LGAs' and 'races' are numbers showing how many of each have been added for this year.
The 'see more' functionality should lead somewhere else, but it is not in the scope of this assignment.

Here is a user story to guide you:

#### User Story:

As a user I would like to add, delete or edit an existing years information on the Election Data Centre control panel.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Be able to see all information displayed in tabular format
- Be able to click add, edit or delete to modify the years in the table
- Be able to quickly find any year no matter how much data there is in the table

Save your design in .png / .jpg / .pdf format along with its original form.

## [Bonus] Task 3

This is a UX thinking exercise

Assess the "Accessibility" & "Usability" of the [Stears Business](https://www.stearsng.com/) home page.

- Identify 3 customer segments for which we might have large numbers of users, but low accessibility and / or usability
- Write a paragraph for each of them explaining how accessibility and usability on the home page can be improved

## Thanks!

If you made it this far, thanks for your time.
We look forward to reviewing your solid application with you!
