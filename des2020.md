# **Design Homework**

**Please complete Task 1 and Task 2. Task 3 is a bonus**

## Task 1

This is an explorative task to see what you come up with.

Users of the [Stears Business website](https://www.stearsng.com) would like to find articles they are interested in quickly. Currently they have to scroll and search through the different pages (business, governance, etc) to find an article they are looking for, based on what group the article seems to fall into.

1. Propose a solution to this problem
2. Create detailed designs showing how a user will use your solution

Submit your designs in [invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) or [figma](https://www.figma.com/) and share with foluso_ogunlana@stearsng.com.

## Task 2

This is a task that represents the kind of work you could do whilst working with us

We need to update the data on the [Election Data Centre](http://nigeriaelections.stearsng.com) site. We would like to start by building a control pane that allows the user do 3 things:

- Bulk upload a .csv file of election datapoints
- Search for a specific datapoint or group of data points by 'state', 'year' or 'candidate'
- Edit a specific datapoint (row of data)

You can visualise a datapoint as a row in the following table:

| Region | State | Year |   Race   |  Candidate   | Incumbent | Party |  Votes  | Won  |
| :----: | :---: | :--: | :------: | :----------: | :-------: | :---: | :-----: | :--: |
|   SW   | LAGOS | 2015 | Governor | Madam Kosase |   FALSE   |  APC  | 3000000 | TRUE |

If you wish, use only 'Governor' as a race, to simplify the data

Here is are a couple of user stories to guide you:

#### User Story 1:

As a user I would like to upload CSV datapoints to the Election Data Centre.

- Given I am on the 'Nigeria' page on the control panel
- When I click 'upload'
- Then I can successfully add a CSV formatted as below:

| Region | State | Year |   Race   |  Candidate   | Incumbent | Party |  Votes  | Won  |
| :----: | :---: | :--: | :------: | :----------: | :-------: | :---: | :-----: | :--: |
|   SW   | LAGOS | 2015 | Governor | Madam Kosase |   FALSE   |  APC  | 3000000 | TRUE |

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Be able to see an upload data button
- Be able to upload data in specified format
- Receive an on-screen confirmation that data has been uploaded

#### User Story 2:

As a user I would like to search for and modify a single data point on the Election Data Centre.

- Given I am on the 'Nigeria' page on the control panel
- When I search (somehow) for a datapoint
- Then I can find and modify the datapoint

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Be able to search for data points by 'state', 'year' or 'candidate'
- Be able to modify any data point found
- Receive an on-screen confirmation that data has been modified

Submit your designs in [invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) or [figma](https://www.figma.com/) and share with foluso_ogunlana@stearsng.com.

## [Bonus] Task 3

This is a UX thinking exercise

Assess the "Accessibility" & "Usability" of the [Stears Business](https://www.stearsng.com/) home page.

- Identify 3 customer segments for which we might have large numbers of users, but low accessibility and / or usability
- Write a paragraph for each of them explaining how accessibility and usability on the home page can be improved

## Thanks!

If you made it this far, thanks for your time.
We look forward to reviewing your solid application with you!
