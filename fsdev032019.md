Stears Coding Homework
======================

Thanks for your application to Stears.
Please complete the following tasks.

* [Coding homework](#coding-homework)
* [Technical questions](#technical-questions)

This interview is intended for an experienced full stack developer. 
It should take you 4-6 hours to complete.

#### Submissions
- Create a private [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) repository and add foluso_ogunlana as a contributor
- Create a README.md with clear set up instructions (assume no knowledge of the submission or the stack)

#### Deadlines
You will be given at least 4 days to complete the tasks below before a phone interview in most cases.

#### Assessment
You will be assessed primarily on the following, **in this order**:
* **Deployment** - Is it easy to deploy or scale in any environment
* **Clean architecture** - Are you using the right design patterns
* **Clean code** - Can other programmers reuse your code
* **User Experience** - Would users be satisfied
* **Documentation** - Do you sufficiently document for others

Also we will give extra points for:
* **Flair** - Surprise us
* **Security** - Keep secrets, passwords and databases safe

###### NOTE
The aim of this assessment is **not** to complete the tasks, though completing the tasks is encouraged. The aim is to demonstrate your skills in good software an UX architecture, learning, and creating maintainable and portable code. We will favour well thought out incomplete tasks to completed tasks made with spaghetti code.

#### Conduct
By submitting, you assure us that you have not shared the test with anyone else and that all work submitted is your own. Though you are allowed to use whatever online or offline resources you see fit to learn skills for the tasks.

## **Coding Homework**

Use NodeJS and VueJS. If you feel you'd rather use something else, please send an email to foluso_ogunlana@stearsng.com to find out if it's okay. Your README.md shoud contain clear instructions on how to build, deploy and maintain the application.

**Please complete task 1 and task 2**

### Task 1

Create a NodeJS express backend with at least one endpoint. `/election-data`. A GET request to this endpoint should return all the data from the the Nigeria 2019 Presidential and Gubernatorial elections. The data itself can be read directly from a .csv file which you can export from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPp3SY7kNOOURNoLQF0EHXBNlmvyPYcUk1eWmwUjTj4/edit?usp=sharing). The spreadsheet has 2 sheets, one with results and one with parties and their colors.

**Next:**

- Create a VueJS 3 single page application with 2 pages. 
- First page is a login. Please provide a default username and password.
- Second page visualises the election data on 2 tables. One showing the presidential election results and the other showing the gubernatorial election results. Each table should have 4 columns: Candidate, Party, Votes and %Votes. And a header titled "Presidential" or "Gubernatorial" election results. The header should be the color of the winning party. You can use this picture for inspiration.

[Example table](../table.png?raw=true "Example Table")

- Write a robust test suite for the backend and frontend with 80% coverage

**Note**
- We expect that your code uses best practices in testing, linting, documentation and architecture
- Make sure to use modern syntax (es6) and a transpiler if you need it

### Task 2

- Serve your backend application and frontend application using `nginx`
- Containerize your application using docker so it can be run using `docker-compose up`
- Provide a kubernetes config `.yaml` file for deploying your application on a cluster
- Write `README.md` file explaining clearly how to set up the application in development (docker compose) and in production (kubernetes)

## Thanks!

If you made it this far, thanks for your time.
We look forward to reviewing your application with you!
